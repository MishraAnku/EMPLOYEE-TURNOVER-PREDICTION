2. PROJECT EXPLANATION:
   The project involves analyzing various factors such as employee demographics, job satisfaction, performance metrics, and other relevant data to build predictive models. These models aim to identify patterns and indicators that suggest an employee might be considering leaving the company.

3. CHALLENGES:
   Challenges in this project may include obtaining accurate and comprehensive data, dealing with imbalanced datasets, interpreting subtle signals of employee dissatisfaction, and ensuring the model's predictions are actionable for the organization.

4. CHALLENGES OVERCOME:
   Challenges can be addressed through robust data collection strategies, feature engineering to address class imbalances, leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, and incorporating feedback mechanisms to refine the model's accuracy over time.

5. AIM:
   The aim is to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving, allowing the organization to implement retention strategies and mitigate the negative impacts of turnover.

6. PURPOSE:
